### Project 2: Dijkstra’s Algorithm

In the Dijkstra’s algorithm, the choice of the input graph representation and the priority
queue implementation will affect its time complexity. 

(a) Suppose the input graph G = (V, E) is stored in an adjacency matrix and we
use an array for the priority queue. Implement the Dijkstra’s algorithm using this
setting and analyze its time complexity with respect to |V| and |E| both
theoretically and empirically.

(b) Suppose the input graph G = (V, E) is stored in an array of adjacency lists and
we use a minimizing heap for the priority queue. Implement the Dijkstra’s
algorithm using this setting and analyze its time complexity with respect to |V|
and |E| both theoretically and empirically.
